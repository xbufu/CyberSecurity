# IT Security

## Intro

This repository is basically a record of my studies in order to become an expert in the IT security industry. My goal is the become a vulnerability researcher with a focus in Linux binary exploitation. 

I will save all my solutions to the different challenges I solved here (if that is allowed by the challenge author), writeups for machines from websites like HackTheBox and my cheat sheets for the tools that I use.

I just started getting into this field around winter 2020, so I am still a beginner. If anyone looking at this repository has anything to add or corrections to make, feel free to make a pull request. I will also try to stream most of the security related stuff I do at <https://www.twitch.tv/0xbufu>.

If you like watching live streams, [ChadB_n00b](https://www.twitch.tv/chadb_n00b) has made a list of a lot of people streaming security related stuff. You can find the list [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR_h7BQvuL0cTfTBPA3ATwv8JZP4_YBsudR_FYoEtcxMD9q0x3KrF_WiHHT6UhzdaXhFt-ZkJ1qHbKZ/pub).
