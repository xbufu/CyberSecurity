# Level 06

The challenge description hints to an old UNIX password format. If we check `/etc/passwd` we can see that the password for `flag06` is still stored in this file. Running `name-that-hash` on the hash we find out it's a `descrypt` hash which is easily crackable with hashcat.

`hashcat -a 0 -m 1500 hash.txt rockyou.txt`
