# Level 09

Running `strings` on the C binary reveals that it is using `execve()` to execute `/usr/bin/php` and passing `/home/flag09/flag09.c` as its arguments. Sicne the php code uses another 2 values from `argv` we can guess they also get passed to `execve()` as parameters. To exploit this we can just pass `-a` as an argument to have php run as an interactive shell.

`/home/flag09/flag09 -a`
